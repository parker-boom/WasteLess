Typography
- Primary display serif (exact family not named in files):
  Used for "Waste Less", "Healthy", "Save", "Reduce", and the large "Aa" sample.
  Visual style: elegant, classic serif with high contrast and soft curves.
- Secondary/support font: "Catchy Mager" (explicitly shown on the board):
  Displayed with full alphabet sample (Aa-Zz) and used as a cleaner, more modern companion.

Visual identity cues
- Main motif: hourglass icon with a tomato at the top, salad bowl at the bottom, and falling ingredients.
- Core message words: Healthy / Save / Reduce.
- Image direction: bright, appetizing food photography (pasta, salad, egg toast, salmon/vegetables).
- Typical contrast pattern: cream text/icons on deep red backgrounds.

Practical usage guidance
- Keep red backgrounds dominant and reserve cream for text, icon lines, and high-contrast highlights.
- Use the serif style for brand-forward headlines/wordmark moments.
- Use Catchy Mager (or nearest available match) for supportive copy and UI text blocks.
